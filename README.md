### helloworld.py
A function can take more than an argument.
######literal - a value of some type: 1) number - 423; 2) word - "Hello World"
######function - a named block of code that we can call by using its name, ex. print()
######argument - a value passed to a function, in order to give it values 

###string.py
If you have to use single quote like (') you need to enclose the string with double quote(")
and the other way around.
######input function - displays the text provided to it, then waits for text to be entered 

###escapechar.py (Escape character)
######backslash(\\) - is used to escape the character that follows it, to give that character special meaning. 
When we have **\n** it causes to start a new line, and **\t** tab the word (used for lists). We can
have a backslash in program if we add another backslash before or add an "**r**" before the quotes.

###Numeric data types
######int - integer the whole numbers, no fraction parts, stored in comp memory, no max size
######float - real numbers, have fractional parts, have 52 digits of precision 

###operators.py
Operators are: +; -, *, /, //,%(mbetja)
#####In Python an expression is anything that can be calculated to return a value

###string2.py
We can pick out single characters or some phrases that we want by using [:]. The counting starts from
0 from left to right and from -1 from right to left. When we make an index with negative numbers we 
need to start from left and go to right. But if we add to the index a negative like[::-1] we have 
to start writing the numbers from right to left. If we write [::no], we write this number to pass 
the values. When we write [::2] we pass the values by two etc.
#####Slicing
Produce a slice by providing three numbers separated colons. Numbers: 1) start; 2) stop; 3) step. 
The start value is the first value, the stop value is the last value.

###sliceback.py
The counting starts from -1 until the end of the variable counting from right to left.

###sequence_oparators.py
5 types: 1) string; 2) list; 3) tuple; 4) range; 5) bytes and bytearrey. Sequence is defined as an 
order set of items. A list is also a sequence type. A sequence is ordered so we can use indexes to 
access individual item in the sequence. Everything that we can do with the string type sequence, we 
can do with every other sequence, with the exeption of range. Range cannot be concatenated or 
multiplied. print("Hello " * 5); print("Hello " * (5 + 4)); print("Hello " * 5 + "4");
print("he" in string1).
